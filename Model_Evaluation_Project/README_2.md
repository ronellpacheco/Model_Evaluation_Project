# CatBoost Model:

- Without tuning: Achieved an F1 score of 0.7595.
- With GridSearchCV tuning: Achieved a slightly lower F1 score of 0.7107.

# Recommendations:

- The CatBoost model without tuning performed reasonably well, indicating that CatBoost is effective for this classification task.
- The decrease in performance after tuning suggests that the default hyperparameters were already well-suited for the data.

# Random Forest Model:

- Without tuning: Achieved an F1 score of 0.6071.
- With GridSearchCV tuning: Achieved a slightly improved F1 score of 0.6089.

# Recommendations:

- The RandomForestClassifier initially performed relatively poorer compared to CatBoost.
- The minor improvement after tuning suggests that RandomForest might not be the best choice for this dataset.

# Data Suitability and Features:

- The data preprocessing involved converting certain columns to string types and handling missing values.
- Categorical features were specified and converted appropriately.
- Class imbalance was addressed using class weights during model training.
- Sampled data was used for grid search to reduce computation time, which is a common practice for large datasets.
- The features used for modeling were chosen based on their relevance to the classification task.

# Recommendations:

- Further exploration of feature engineering techniques might help improve model performance.
- t's essential to understand the business context and ensure that the chosen features align with the problem statement.
- Consideration of additional features or different encoding techniques might be beneficial for improving model performance.

# Brief analysis:

- Upon evaluating the performance of the CatBoost and RandomForest models for the classification task, it's evident that CatBoost     outperformed RandomForest both in terms of default performance and after hyperparameter tuning. The CatBoost model achieved an F1 score of 0.7595 without tuning and slightly decreased to 0.7107 after GridSearchCV tuning. In contrast, RandomForest initially yielded a lower F1 score of 0.6071, with only a slight improvement to 0.6089 post-tuning. This indicates that CatBoost's intrinsic ability to handle categorical features effectively and its robustness to hyperparameters contributed to its superior performance.
